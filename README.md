Correlation btw air quality and asthma emergency visits 2012_2016

Increased wildfire activity across California in recent decades has become a serious threat to
nearly all dwellings in California. However, an increase in population and the steady sprawl of
cities and dwellings toward the forests, as well as distinctive drought periods and beetle
infestations, have enhanced the size and destructiveness of wildfires over the last decade. The
devastating wildfires not only burned hundreds of thousand hectares of land, countless homes,
and caused fatalities, but also contributed to a serious health problem. The air quality decreased
significantly in those areas, which in turn has increased respiratory syndrome instances even at
large distances from the fires. 

In this research, the correlation between air quality and emergency visits by asthma patients in California was investigated. While other studies and spatial solutions contain merely one topic, such as air quality, health-related data, or fire activity, this study will investigate a more complex and linked support tool. The tool will initiate a broader
investigation on socioeconomic and health-related impacts of wildfires in California.
